- Source: [Kaggle Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/data)
- Includes:
  - `train/` folder with images
  - `train.csv` file with image filenames and numeric labels

## How to Train (Colab)
1. Open [`cassava_training.ipynb`](notebooks/cassava_training.ipynb) in Google Colab
2. Mount your Google Drive
3. Upload your dataset (`train/` and `train.csv`)
4. Run all cells â€” training, evaluation, and export

## Label Map

```python
label_map = {
    0: "Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)",
    1: "Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)",
    2: "Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)",
    3: "Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)",
    4: "Healthy"
}
